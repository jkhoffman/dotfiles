Build docs
==========

To build the documentation for checking your edits, try the HTML target: `make html` and open `_build/index.html`.


Prompts Comparison
==================

The prompts comparison table source `prompts comparison.ods` is an Open Document Sheet produced with LibreOffice (6.4.7.2), then exported to PDF, then exported to SVG with Inkscape (1.2).

It is this SVG that is included in the documentation, so if you edit the source table, do not forget to export it to SVG as well.


Logo
====

The font used in the SVG logo is "TeX Gyre Chorus".
