Liquid Prompt's documentation
=============================

*Liquid Prompt* is an adaptive prompt for Bash & Zsh that gives you a nicely
displayed prompt with useful information when you need it. It does this with a
powerful theming engine and a large array of data sources.

If you just want a short overview of the main Liquid Prompt features,
see the ":doc:`overview`" section.

To actually get started, view the :doc:`install` documentation, which includes
instructions for trying Liquid Prompt temporarily.

To know more about the available features, see the :doc:`theme` section,
which has some explanations on what's displayed on your prompt,
and the :doc:`config`, which lists all that change the behavior of the prompt.

For making your own theme, see the :doc:`theme/custom` section. If you need to
dig more in the code, you can browse the :doc:`functions` section.

To check what changed in a release, check the :doc:`release-notes`,
and if you plan to do an upgrade, see :doc:`upgrading`,
and look for *deprecated options*.
